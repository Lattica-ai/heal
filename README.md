# HEAL: Homomorphic Encryption Abstraction Layer

Welcome to the HEAL Runtime Repository ‚Äî your integration point for executing homomorphic AI workloads on your hardware.

HEAL defines a minimal, standardized API for homomorphic encryption (FHE) operations, enabling hardware vendors to plug into real-world encrypted AI pipelines with ease.

---

## üöÄ Overview

This repository provides everything you need to integrate and test your hardware implementation against HEAL:

- üîå C++ function definitions and sample implementations
- üß™ Unit tests with known input/output pairs
- üß† Python-based runtime that executes AI workloads from JSON transcripts
- üìä Benchmarking hooks for performance tuning

---

## üì¶ Repository Structure

```
example_impl/         # Example C++ implementations of HEAL functions (to be replaced by vendor code)
include/              # API headers: memory, arithmetic, shape, etc.
python_execution/     # Python runtime for executing HEAL transcripts
tests/                # Unit tests for each function
example_transcripts/  # Example JSON-based AI workloads
example_run_transcript.py  # Entry point to run a test workload
```

> **Note:** `example_impl/` provides a sample implementation. Hardware vendors should replace this with their own optimized implementation targeting their device.

---

## üí™ Build Instructions

### 1. Requirements

- C++17 or later
- CMake ‚â• 3.14
- Python ‚â• 3.8
- Pybind11 (auto-installed by CMake)
- A C++ compiler (GCC recommended, e.g., g++. Note: clang++ may cause build issues)

### 2. Build C++ Runtime & Bindings

* Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```
Replace `{repository-url}` and `{repository-directory}` with the actual URL and directory name.

* Create a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

* Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

* Install the Python runtime library:

```bash
pip install -e python_execution
```

This installs the Python bindings necessary for running HEAL scripts.

* Create a build directory:

```bash
mkdir build
```

* Navigate into the build directory:

```bash
cd build
```

* Generate build files using CMake:

```bash
cmake ..
```

* Compile the HEAL runtime and Python bindings:
```bash
make -j
```

This completes building the C++ runtime and Python bindings for HEAL.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Example Pipeline

After completing the build steps above, you can run a simulated AI model using HEAL by executing the example script provided.

From the root directory of the HEAL repository, run:

```bash
python example_run_transcript.py
```

This will:
1. Load `standalone_matmul_simple.json`
2. Call your C++ function implementations through the Python runtime
3. Print output and runtime logs

---

## ‚úÖ Running Unit Tests

From the build directory:

```bash
ctest --output-on-failure
```

This runs all unit tests from the `/tests` directory to verify correctness.

To run a single test executable directly and see detailed success/failure logs, execute the test binary itself:

```bash
./tests/<test_executable>
```

Replace `{test_executable}` with the actual name of your test binary.
